# Libre
## What even is a "Libre"
Libre is a multipurpose discord bot. Currently Libre supports responding to messages and various fun commands, as well as other less fun commands. As well, Libre has music functionality built into it, which will be improved upon in the future.
## What will Libre do in the future
Currently I have plans to incorporate a language model (GPT probably) so that what it says makes more sense. Other functionality would be more fun commands and music updates.
